# Notes
Double click bug: double clicking in quick succession on any element of the wallpaper will remove/create top and bottom text but keep flexbox formatting the same.

Initial wallpaper works fine if opened with live server; however, if HTML file is opened locally top and bottom text initially show when they're supposed to be hidden.
